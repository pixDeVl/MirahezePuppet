#   This class installs the cpufrequtils package and ensures a configured
#   CPU frequency governor is set.
# @param governor
#   Which governor to use. Defaults to 'performance'. Run 'cpufreq-info -g'
#   to obtain a list of available governors.
# @example
#
#  class { 'cpufrequtils':
#    governor => 'powersave',
#  }
